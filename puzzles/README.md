# Summary of Puzzles
This document summarizes the dataset stored in the `puzzles.json` file in this directory. 
These files are generated from the `generators/*.py` files.
The only import for puzzles is `from typing import List` but you should also pass a candidate solution 
through `type_check` from `puzzle_generator.py` before certifying correctness.

* <a name="minsquareddeviation"></a>**MinSquaredDeviation** Loosely inspired by [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) \#4
    
    The HumanEval problem was simply to compute the mean absolute deviation. This problem is more interesting.
    It requires minimizing the sum of squared deviations, which turns out to be the mean `mu`. Moreover, if
    `mu` is the mean of the numbers then a simple calculation shows that:
    
    `sum((mu - n) ** 2 for n in nums) == sum((m - n) ** 2 for m in nums for n in nums) / (2 * len(nums))`
    
    We use 0.501 rather than 1/2 to deal with rounding errors. (5 instances)

    The original problem was trivial to list the even single-digit numbers between two numbers:
    `a=2, b=12` => `[4, 6, 8]`. In this puzzle, we consider the string of even numbers formed when counting from
    `a` to `b`, e.g., `"1618202224262830"` when counting from `15` to `30`. The puzzle is, given such a string,
    find `a` and `b`. (5 instances)

* <a name="graphisomorphism"></a>**GraphIsomorphism** The classic [Graph Isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) problem.
    It is unknown whether or not there exists a polynomial-time algorithm
    for this problem, though an unpublished quasi-polynomial-time algorithm has been announced by Babai.
    
    The classic version is a decision problem: given two graphs, determine whether or not they are isomorphic.
    However, it is polynomial-time equivalent to the one below through a standard reduction. In particular, if you
    could solve the search problem below (finding the actual bijection), then you can decide isomorphism because the
    search solver would simply fail on non-isomorphic graphs. Conversely, if you could solve the decision problem,
    then you can find a bijection as follows: if the decider determines that the graphs are isomorphic, for each node
    in the first graph, find a corresponding node in the second graph as follows. Add N self-edges from the node to
    itself where N is the maximum degree in the graph + 1, and do that for each candidate node in the second graph.
    For each of these additions, test isomorphism. If the graphs are isomorphic then there must be a bijection that maps
    the first node to the second. Repeat this for each node until you have found a bijection. (If self-loops are not
    allowed, one can do this by adding N additional nodes for each test. (5 instances)

        You are to choose locations for bridge bases from among a given set of mountain peaks located at
        `xs, ys`, where `xs` and `ys` are lists of n integers of the same length. Your answer should be a sorted
        list of indices starting at 0 and ending at n-1. The goal is to minimize building costs such that the bridges
        are feasible. The bridges are all semicircles placed on top of the pillars. The feasibility constraints are that:
        * The bridges may not extend above a given height `H`. Mathematically, if the distance between the two xs
        of adjacent pillars is d, then the semicircle will have radius `d/2` and therefore the heights of the
        selected mountain peaks must both be at most `H - d/2`.
        *  The bridges must clear all the mountain peaks, which means that the semicircle must lie above the tops of the
        peak. See the code for how this is determined mathematically.
        * The total cost of all the bridges must be at most `thresh`, where the cost is parameter alpha * (the sum of
        all pillar heights) + beta * (the sum of the squared diameters)

* <a name="exponentialcoinmoves"></a>**ExponentialCoinMoves** This problem has *long* answers, not that the code to solve it is long but that what the solution outputs is long.
    
    The version below uses only 5 boxes (unlike the IMO problem with 6 boxes since 2010^2010^2010 is too big
    for computers) but the solution is quite similar to the solution to the IMO problem. Because the solution
    requires exponential many moves, our representation allows combining multiple Type-1 (advance) operations
    into a single step.

        There are five boxes each having one coin initially. Two types of moves are allowed:
        * (advance) remove `k > 0` coins from box `i` and add `2k` coins to box `i + 1`
        * (swap) remove a coin from box `i` and swap the contents of boxes `i+1` and `i+2`
        Given `0 <= n <= 16385`, find a sequence of states that result in 2^n coins in the last box.
        Note that `n` can be as large as 16385 yielding 2^16385 coins (a number with 4,933 digits) in the last
        box. Encode each state as a list of the numbers of coins in the five boxes.

    which include several *unsolved* factoring problems put out by the RSA company. The challenge was closed in 2007,

    A solution to this problem would disprove the *Collatz Conjecture*, also called the *3n + 1 problem*,
    as well as the *Generalized Collatz Conjecture* (see the next problem).
    According to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):
    > Paul Erdos said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems."
    > He also offered US$500 for its solution. Jeffrey Lagarias stated in 2010 that the Collatz conjecture
    > "is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics."
    
    Consider the following process. Start with an integer `n` and repeatedly applying the operation:
    * if n is even, divide n by 2,
    * if n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1
    
    The conjecture is to that all `n > 0` eventually reach `n=1`. If this conjecture is false, then
    there is either a cycle or a sequence that increases without bound. This problem seeks a cycle. (1 instance)

    Consider the following process. Start with an integer `n` and repeatedly applying the operation:
    * if n is even, divide n by 2,
    * if n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1
    Find `0 < n < upper` so that it takes exactly `t` steps to reach 1.
    
    
    For instance,
    the number `n=9780657630` takes 1,132 steps and the number `n=93,571,393,692,802,302` takes
    2,091 steps, according to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
    
    Now, this problem can be solved trivially by taking exponentially large `n = 2 ** t` so we also bound the
    number of bits of the solution to be upper.
